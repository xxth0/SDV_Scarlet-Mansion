	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.IndoorNight.0": "I found myself in a really nostalgic mood tonight, so I got out my diary.#$e#It brought back memories. Do you think it's strange that I have so much to be grateful for in life?",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.IndoorNight.1": "How are you feeling? Are you sleepy?#$e#I might go to bed early as well, I'm not used to being around humans at such late hours of the day.#$b#But for you? I could make an exception.",

	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Bad.7": "Get out of my face. Who do you think you are, abandoning me, then suddenly coming back?#$b#For what? You don't give a damn about me.#$b#Just like everyone else.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Bad.8": "Love, what is it? I could only see a complete stranger. But no, wait.#$b#You were me, centuries ago. You are a failed, hurt version of me.#$e#Disappointing... disgusting... shameful...#$e#But I still want to believe you’re better than that...",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Bad.9": "I know I came to you to get away from the pain and loss, the feeling of loneliness. I came, hoping to find peace.#$b#But instead, I found nothing. Worse than that, a cruel ending.#$b#Now, I'll never return.",
	
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.0": "Shh... quiet, now. Listen to the sound of the falling leaves...#$b#It's nature's lullaby. Let it fill your heart, and calm your mind.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.1": "If you get thirsty, I have some freshly squeezed juice ready for you. [612]#$e#No, I didn't steal it from your crop, it's from my home. It should make you feel well rested.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.2": "Tending to the farm is both necessary and taxing.#$b#If it ever becomes too much, know that you can always take a break.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.3": "Some wine or drinks may help clear your head. It worked for me, anyway.#$b#One glass of merlot always brings a smile to my face.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.4": "Autumn is nice, isn't it? Don't spend too much time outdoors, though. The cool air can bring you fever.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.5": "You work so hard my love. I'm proud of you. But do take some time for yourself. Our relationship matters just as much as everything else, okay?",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.6": "Are you happy with our relationship? Sometimes, I wonder what goes on in your mind. I guess the mystery is part of your charm, huh? Anyway, if you can take time away from work, I'd be pleased to talk.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.7": "Being in love is very different from being indifferent towards someone. Sometimes I have to remind myself that no matter what happens, I'll never stop caring.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.8": "I still get sentimental over small things. Like how you talk to me, and how the rays of the setting sun glance off of your cheek.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Neutral.9": "We should grow some plants together. And since we're together now, feel free to use the greenhouse at my mansion. It's yours too. #$b#Don't worry about it. We'll have plenty of room for all kinds of plants.",
	
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.0": "Love is selfless, endless, pure. You know I've had that in mind every time I met you. No matter how complicated, tough or impossible it was. Every choice and action - that is how I love.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.1": "Dearest, I can't help but notice how much effort you put into farming... It is truly one of life's masterpieces. A picture so vivid and charming, yet never completely captures the essence of a human spirit. So simple and honest... just like us.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.2": "If something ever bothers you, I'm here. There's no need to keep your feelings locked up. Vent it out, let it go, whatever you need. Just know I'm always here, right beside you, every step of the way. $b#I love you, so much.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.3": "I admire your life decision and moved to the Valley, which I later discovered, to be the most beautiful place on earth. Everywhere is filled with the aroma of this place, the sense of freedom and the peace I need. Thanks to you I had the best time of my life.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.4": "I'd love to help out the farm, with harvesting or planting... or whatever you need, really. I'm good with farm work. And I just wanna help out and relax as much as possible. Life can get exhausting, so whenever I get the chance, I'm gonna live the way I like to live. With you, my beloved, by my side...",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.5": "Do you like this season? I thought so, considering how cheerful you look. Though I don't have much love for winter... mostly because of my skin condition. But knowing I have a loving partner, I won't be unhappy anymore. Having someone to share this amazing life with means more than the power of the Vampire Lord.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.6": "How about some pumpkin soup, my dear? I remember it's one of your favourites. Ah, here is a hot cup of tea for you, too. Perfectly suited for a chilly day like this.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.7": "You see those trees? Every year, they shed their green leaves in favor of bright red and orange ones. They prepare for a long sleep, deep in the hibernation grounds. They become stronger for when spring comes along, where a new birth awaits.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.8": "There's a reason this season is called Autumn: the fall of the leaves, symbolizing decay and mortality. Yet many find beauty in its simplicity, in the impermanence and unpredictability of nature. Just as our love grows and matures with each passing day.",
	"Spouse.Xeth.Fall.Dialogue.Good.9": "Whenever I look at you, the feeling in my heart stays the same. It doesn't change, doesn't waver... Stay with me, forever. I am so happy.",

	"Felix.Fall.Thu.6h": "I heard at the deepest part of the mine... There are some kind of a key down there... And if I'm not mistaken, Infernus also tried to find more minerals there... #$7#That place is... really... scary...",
	"Felix.Fall.Thu.8h": "Uh oh! Pixie is playing around with my utensils again. If you need more food, it won't be done in time before she takes it away from the stove... #$7",

He knows what I'm feeling... and... what's happening around us...#b#And it's always cold when he does it too... #7$7#Maybe he could be our main guard here since he can see and know things like that, but... He doesn't have any interest in that. I don't think...",
	"Felix.Fall.Thu.10h_4": "If you look closely to Aurelius, you might have noticed that his clothes is different than everyone else's. More casual and not so formal... He said it's what he was wearing when he was small and... he doesn't want to change. He looks... nice.#b#Just... just don't ask him about it...",

	"Felix.Fall.Fri.0h": "I'll close the window today so we won't feel too cold inside.",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.2h": "We have enough food to last a while and it's enough to keep everyone in this mansion from going hungry. And the ingredients for Pixie's dessert are in the fridge.",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.4h": "... This autumn is too quiet without Pixie's presence in the mansion. She's just playing around in the garden today, and it's much safer.",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.6h": "This season, there's more leftover for us to eat because of Master Xeth's... failed attempt at cooking... He tried hard to make his dish presentable to everyone.#b#It's very... heartwarming to see that, actually.",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.8h": "A while ago, Pixie came running inside with her hands full of berries and nuts. It's so messy.#$b#And Infernus's invention almost blew up again!",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.10h_1": "... Sometimes I felt that this mansion is... not for me to live in... But when I see Pixie, she reminded me why I'm here, what's the most important thing is. She's our treasure to protect.",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.10h_2": "There's an extra dish for you, it's a hotpot with many mushrooms in them. Enjoy!",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.10h_3": "Please check our wine cellar if you want a bottle of wine to drink. And please make sure Pixie doesn't drink it. That little girl... #$b#She will get sick from that!",
	"Felix.Fall.Fri.10h_4": "Tsk, Pixie is making a mess again, and I have to clean them up. She doesn't have to make a huge mess and waste so much of the food that I have just cleaned.",
	
	// Saturday //
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.0h": "... Have you seen Pixie's drawing of...#6#Uh...#7#Something like that? #$b#It's hanging in the hallway on the first floor and you should check it out.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.2h": "Have I told you how Infernus tried to get rid of me when I first came to this mansion? $7#That dwarf was very wary of me. He said that he doesn't trust me that much because I'm not from the valley, so... it's not wrong. #7",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.4h": "Pixie loves it when Infernus brings back some minerals he found in the mines.#b#They are beautiful, she said, so... #7#I hope she wouldn't drop it by accident...",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.6h": "Master Xeth's face always turns cold when Aurelius mentioned the past. It's his bad experience I assume, and he just... doesn't like to be reminded of that...",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.8h": "When Aurelius walks around this mansion, I feel really uneasy, just like what he always told me. It's like he sees more than anyone could, but he never tells what is it exactly.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.10h_1": "For dinner tonight, I thought we could have some delicious beef stew, how does that sounds? Master Xeth would cook it for you with his special touch. ... Oh, you're right... He still needs more practice. Well... you will help us by telling us how to make it right?",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.10h_2": "Here, let me make sure you have enough food for tonight. Here are some cookies and bread for your meal. Master Xeth made them! Isn't he so good?",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.10h_3": "When I was about to finish preparing your meal, Pixie ran off with it. If she comes to you, just ask her to share.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sat.10h_4": "Before Master Xeth's parent's death, he has been doing so well for his family business and... his relationship with his friends. I wonder where did we go wrong? Witch's curse? Ah... I see now. That's why he despised The Wizard now, even though his parents didn't...#$7#Anyway, if you want to ask Master Xeth, be sure to ask him nicely or he won't open up about it...",

	"Felix.Fall.Sun.0h": "Did Pixie eat my cookie dough? It was supposed to be my midnight snack! #$b#That little... $b$",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.2h": "In my opinion, Pixie likes to explore too much. If she went somewhere else without telling me, I'll panic. And... I bet Infernus would do something worse if that happens.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.4h": "This dish would warm you up during this chilly evening. Have a bite. #$1",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.6h": "The thing about this season is, it's easier for Master Xeth to get out more, but the cold air always makes me shiver...",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.8h": "Do you have a place where you want to go during autumn? There's always nice place to go outside in the valley, even though there are monsters here and there. If you need a recommendation, you can ask Infernus for it.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.10h_1": "There are lots of pumpkins in Master Xeth's field this year and he needs to pick all of them. Here, have this pumpkin pie. It's Pixie's favorite too, and we all want her to be happy, don't we? #$b#This pie has lots of love and warmth, just like Pixie...",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.10h_2": "The flowers and leaves on Master Xeth's courtyard will change color from green to red and orange in autumn, so it will make his field look really beautiful.",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.10h_3": "Whenever Autumn comes, it reminds me of... the times when Pixie still young. Master Xeth's always so loving with her, and she likes to run around everywhere... It was just... fun, you know?",
	"Felix.Fall.Sun.10h_4": "One day I tried to climb the roof to clean them but Master Xeth scolded me... saying I will break a leg. ... Maybe that's a bit extreme. ... But then Aurelius just said it's because he  doesn't want to see me in pain, so I stopped trying. And maybe I'll do the same during Winter.#b#But for now, the leaves will be nice.",

	"Felix.Winter.Mon.2h": "Winter is cold but at least I don’t have to water Master Xeth's crops anymore, so I'll take that.",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.4h": "Brr!! This morning when I open the window, the wind makes my eyes hurt!",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.6h": "Last winter, Infernus went out and brought home a bunch of metals and crystals...#$2#It was hard to keep Pixie from them because...#$7#It looks so pretty to her!",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.8h": "Winter reminds me of Master Xeth and... what happened in the past. If you want to know more, maybe you should ask him, not me... It's too hard to speak of it...",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.10h_1": "Winter makes it a lot more convenient to clean our mansion because there's not so many plants and weeds outside... But clearing snow can be a chore!",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.10h_2": "Snow makes Pixie's mood become really... wild and it makes me wonder how much fun she is having playing with snow! And Master is kind enough to let her play outside...",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.10h_3": "In Master Xeth's garden, he usually has many green sprouts and vegetables growing here and there.#But during the Winter, it's almost empty. Maybe he may allow you to plant something there if you’ve earned his trust.",
	"Felix.Winter.Mon.10h_4": "Please check on Aurelius if you need anything, because his presence might not be there for the entire year and he wouldn't know you're calling him if you're just in front of him...",
	
	// Tuesday //
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.0h": "Let me help  you clean up the snow on your boots...",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.2h": "I feel really sleepy now, the cold air makes my body really... weak...",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.4h": "Ah... I remember that when Master Xeth was young, he always came out of his room on a cold day with a blanket, and then he would snuggle into the sofa next to me...",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.6h": "It was Aurelius who taught Pixie how to write and do basic math, and he's pretty smart. Oh, he used to be an aspiring researcher before...",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.8h": "Pixie can't help much in Winter since she gets cold so easily, and it's not good for her health.",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.10h_1": "Have some extra soup to keep yourself warm during this freezing time. There's some chicken, carrot and onion inside it. It should be good for your body, and don't worry if it tastes different.",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.10h_2": "Infernus hates winter and it makes me laugh... because he can't even tell a joke.",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.10h_3": "There's this weird plant that only grows in winter, I've never seen anything like it, and I wonder how it looks like... It's similar to a melon but blue? Or maybe a winter melon? That sounds funny.",
	"Felix.Winter.Tue.10h_4": "Sometimes I get annoyed at Master Xeth when he gets out without a thicker jacket on his back, it's so cold out there and he could easily catch a cold!",
	
	// Wednesday //
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.0h": "Brrr... I hope we get warmer soon.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.2h": "The only way to get warmer during this cold season is to stay by the fireplace... There's also one at Infernus's workshop, so I can go there too if it's really cold!",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.4h": "If you ever see Infernus and Aurelius having a long and serious conversation, you can ignore it because it's about things that I can't understand... They're bunch of nerds.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.6h": "Do you see Pixie's drawing that she put on the table? That's Master Xeth!#He has a kind heart but... He has his flaws too, and we're still working on that.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.8h": "There's a room under the roof where we put dozen of empty beds for workers back then, but... There's just five of us, and it feels weird.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.10h_1": "Aurelius can manifest himself during the Winter because it's when he has more energy in his physical body. I guess...#It's because he can absorb energy from the Winter Spirit... #$b#Just ask him about it and he'll probably be more than glad to explain.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.10h_2": "You must be exhausted walking all the way here. Master Xeth was very generous and he put his heart to make you some stew and pie. You can eat them to keep you warm.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.10h_3": "Here you go. This soup will help you get back up and I know you like to do it with your own strength. That's a very good trait.",
	"Felix.Winter.Wed.10h_4": "In our house, Master Xeth would love to bake sweets for Pixie on winter nights. His cooked foods are still terrible... I tried to help, but it turns out worse. Ahaha!",
	
	// Thursday //
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.0h": "You must be freezing outside, come here to sit down next to the fireplace and drink some soup.",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.2h": "Today's a quiet day, isn't it? And it's a bit colder than before too... But that's fine, at least Master Xeth gets more chances to go outside now.",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.4h": "How do I spend winter days, you ask? I spend my days with Pixie mostly, sometimes she comes up and we just... play around. ... If that answers your question.#b#Master Xeth and Infernus aren't interested in this activity so I have to keep an eye on her at all times... It can be hard though.#6#She's a sneaky kid!",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.6h": "Today I have to cook a very special recipe for Pixie and Master Xeth, so please give me a bit more time.",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.8h": "Yesterday Master Xeth caught Pixie when she was playing with my utensils, but he didn't scold her. Instead he just said... 'Play nicely, or it will be me who will be scolding you'...",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.10h_1": "In winter season, I don't think I can go anywhere because it's too cold. At least the food supply in the fridge is enough for everyone!",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.10h_2": "Winter makes Pixie very wild. She wants to get out of the mansion and just play in the snow!#$b#And it's not safe at all, so Master Xeth and I must be more cautious...",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.10h_3": "The basement has many furnaces that we can use to make metal ingots or charcoal.#If you're interested in that, maybe Infernus can help you.",
	"Felix.Winter.Thu.10h_4": "A long time ago, Aurelius, Infernus, Master Xeth and I were having a nice evening... but suddenly a snowstorm appeared! And the power went out!$1$7#It was terrible!",

	"Felix.Winter.Fri.2h.cc_boiler.completed": "You can see the minecart to the mine from our mansion basement...  It's functional again and Infernus was so happy.#But I haven't used it yet so I don't know how it works.",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.4h": "If you don't want to go anywhere outside because the temperature is too low, I have some hot cocoa for you in the kitchen. $2#You're welcome to make some for yourself. But please, clean the mug after you're done with it.",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.6h": "Did Infernus bother you with his experiment again? It's dangerous so you need to stay away from it if you can't help him with his machine!#And don't ask Aurelius for help because he will just shrug!",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.8h": "I made some chocolate cake with Pixie's help, she wanted to surprise Master Xeth with her baking skills. And... Well... Let's just say we were successful with our mission...",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.10h_1": "Aurelius used to be so close with Master Xeth's parents, that they always visit him.#I can still remember that... It was such a happy moment...",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.10h_2": "At some times Master Xeth gets bored easily and he would ask for our help to find some activity to do... So I simply tell him to do farming. Now look at the greenhouse... It's my job again!",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.10h_3": "I just remembered one day when Aurelius told Pixie some spooky stories, so that night, she can't sleep.#She came to our rooms, asking if she could stay there with us...#It's quite funny now when I look back...",
	"Felix.Winter.Fri.10h_4": "During Winter, Infernus works on some kind of metal that he wants to show to Master Xeth later... and the thing that he has been doing for these past years always surprises me.",

	// Saturday //
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.0h": "You don't look good... maybe you should wear warmer clothes next time...",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.2h": "During this cold winter season, you'll get more chance to talk with everyone here because we refused to go outside too much.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.4h": "There are plenty of food in the fridge to warm your body if you're too cold. Please make yourself comfortable. We'll try our best to provide what you need.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.6h.Xeth8hEvent.unseen": "Uh, it's been a while since the last time I had some quality time with Pixie, I really miss her hugs. $3#But then she will start asking me questions like 'Felix, where is my dad?' and I just can't say it because Master Xeth...#$e#I don't even know how to describe it...#b#I can't say it's fine but I just can't...",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.6h.Xeth8hEvent.seen": "Uh, it's been a while since the last time I had some quality time with Pixie, I really miss her hugs. After I knew she is Wizard's daughter, I...$3#I have to say... I'm glad... She has been... the happiest and most adorable child ever. Also, do keep an eye on her when she walk to the Wizard tower for me, okay? She may go missing at some points, and Master Xeth will panic for a while...$e#Oh... I need to make sure he doesn't hear about it. If that's alright?",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.8h": "Sometimes Pixie makes me a lot of snowballs so that I could make a snowman for her...#But she has too many and it becomes a pain!#7#At least she was happy when we made the snowman! #6$b#The cold was worth it.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.10h_1": "Our pantry and the fridge will be stocked with food so that Master Xeth doesn't have to buy groceries from town.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.10h_2": "Sometimes, when I go into the kitchen to clean some mess, I find a pile of ingredients sitting there.#They are so weird and I just... I'm not sure how to use them.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.10h_3": "Aurelius tends to walk around the mansion aimlessly at some times and I still have no clue on how to read him... But one day, he showed me the spot that needs some cleaning or repairing...#So maybe it's not so hard to read him after all. He just has a weird way to say it.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sat.10h_4": "Infernus came back home a few weeks ago, with his backpack full of rocks and ores... He was happy to be back after spending some time in the mines. I really want to see how's the inside looks like...",

	"Felix.Winter.Sun.6h": "Sometimes, when Master Xeth wants to take a break from farming, he spends his time with Pixie. And sometimes it just... makes me think about my family... But they're long gone now... I don't even know where they are right now...#b#I really want them to live happily in the town they're staying right now.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sun.8h": "There's not so much to do today except preparing Pixie's and Master Xeth's meal, so... you're welcome to check up on us for dinner. Or... for some warm cocoa.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sun.10h_1": "After what happened with his parents, Master Xeth just... got sad.#And that made Aurelius sad too... I think. I heard the guy sobbing one time and I was too scared to look... I don't know if Infernus heard it too though. #b#If you need anything, just call me and I will be there in no time.",
	"Felix.Winter.Sun.10h_2": "There's a plushie inside Pixie's room, do you remember that one? We called them Luna. They came from a game called NEODITRONIX made by Author's best friend.#$e#Pixie would really love to show it to you if you want!",
	"Felix.Winter.Sun.10h_3": "For now, my main concern is how Aurelius and Pixie gets along so well. They have some similarities I can tell... But... I just can't pinpoint what exactly...#$e#Eye colors? I'm not sure.",

He would change them.#$e#I don't want to say this... When I checked his wardrobe... it's full of white gowns. There are lots of them...

	"Aurelius.Gift.Category.Cooking": "... @. Do you realize that I can't eat those... right? I wish I could.",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.0h": "I know you're going to visit Xeth soon.#$b#I just wanted to say thank you for being his friend. He really needs one.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.2h": "Ah, you're here again... I wish I could talk to you more, but I'm afraid my energy isn't enough.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.4h": "I heard that you sometimes visit the mines.#$b#Please be careful. I don't want to lose another friend...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.6h": "Felix... He's a Shadow brute, but he's actually really nice.#$b#I can tell that he cares a lot about Xeth and Pixie.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.8h": "You and Xeth have gotten quite close, huh?#$b#It makes me happy to see that he's found a good friend.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Mon.10h": "Thank you for visiting me, @! It makes me happy to see you.#$b#You're such a good friend...",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.0h": "... Sometimes I feel lonely, even though I'm surrounded by people. Maybe it's because I'm dead...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.2h": "Do you think I could pass on soon? I'm tired of being a ghost...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.4h": "I have my own bedroom here, but I don't really sleep.#$e#I don't have any need for it.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.6h": "Do you think Xeth will ever find a cure for himself?#$e#I hope he does... I know how much it hurts him to be like this.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.8h": "Xeth is my best friend. I wish he would talk to me more often.#$b#I feel like he's been avoiding me lately... I don’t know why...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Tue.10h": "Hey, @… Do you think we can be more than just friends?#$e#Too bad, I can't be romanced.#$b#If you’re interested, maybe you can try ask the author, she may consider it.",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.0h": "... Sometimes I feel lonely, even though I'm surrounded by people. Maybe it's because I'm dead...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.2h": "I once possessed a toy in Xeth's room.#$b#I was just curious, and I wanted to see what it was like to be a doll.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.4h": "I can't leave this mansion, and I can't go to the other side... It's like I'm trapped here forever.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.6h": "Sometimes, I can sense the emotions of people around me.#$b#It's a little bit annoying, but I can't really do much about it.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.8h": "My gravestone is in the forest near here. Though there are only mine and Infernus.#$b#Felix isn’t in there. He became a shadow brute so we have nothing to bury.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Wed.10h": "I miss being alive, you know? I miss all the things I used to do before I died...#$b#It seems so simple back then...",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.0h": "Boo...#$b#Did I scare you? I'm sorry if I did. I was just trying to be funny.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.2h": "Felix… He's a good man. I don't know why he became a Shadow Brute.#$b#But he seems like he's done a lot of good for Xeth and Pixie.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.4h": "Floating around and talking to people is pretty much all I can do.#$e# It's not as fun as it sounds, though.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.6h": "I can't feel my body, or my limbs. But I can still feel other sensations...#$e#I wish I didn't though...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.8h": "Xeth and Felix... They're both good men. They've done a lot for me.#$e#I wish there was something I could do to repay them.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Thu.10h": "I can see other ghosts. They don't talk much, though.#$b#But I still try to communicate with them.",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.0h": "I can walk through walls. I don't know why, but I guess it's just something that ghosts can do.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.2h": "It’s rare to have a visitor here, especially someone like you.#$e#I hope we can get to know each other better.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.4h": "Infernus doesn’t leave his workshop, but he still wants to help Xeth and Pixie.#$e#He's a good man, even though he's a little bit strange...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.6h": "I like the smell of Felix’s cooking.#$b#Too bad I can’t eat it anymore...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.8h": "Thanks for visiting, @... I hope you can come again next time.#$b#I always look forward to it.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Fri.10h": "The feeling of being a ghost is quite different than what I thought.#$b#I always thought it'd be fun to walk through walls or go through people.#$b#But now... I don't think so...",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.0h": "Have you ever felt like you're stuck in a place where you can't escape from?#$e#That's how I feel right now.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.2h": "I can manifest as a human form sometimes.#$b#It takes a lot of energy out of me, but it's worth it.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.4h": "Hey, @. Do you think we can be friends?#$e#I've been feeling lonely lately, and I would like someone to talk to.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.6h": "You remind me of myself, @.#$b#You're always so full of life, and you're always smiling. It's a good thing...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.8h": "Did I scare you? Sorry... That wasn’t my intention...#$e#I just wanted to surprise you, that's all.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sat.10h": "Sometimes, I try to scare people, just for the fun of it especially Pixie, but she always just run away...",
	
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.0h": "I heard that Xeth is going to the mines to look for some gems.#$b#I'm glad he's finally going outside again.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.2h": "I miss being alive. I miss eating, sleeping, and doing all the things normal people can do.#$b#For now, I could only wander and talk to others...",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.4h": "I wish I could help Felix with house chores.#$b#But I'm afraid my hands will go through the objects.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.6h": "Felix once tried to catch me with a butterfly net, but it went right through me. It was very amusing.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.8h": "I think Pixie is annoying but I understand. She was left by her parents.#$b#Xeth saved her. He can't say no to a child that needs help.",
	"Aurelius.Spring.Sun.10h": "When I was alive, I liked to sing songs for the children.#$b#They would always smile and laugh, and it made me happy...",
	
	"Aurelius.Summer.Mon.6h": "Even if Xeth has lots of money, health can't be bought back."
